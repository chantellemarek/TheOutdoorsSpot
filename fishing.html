        <h1>Fishing</h1>
          <p>
          The state of Wiscosnin has 160 different fish species! Most of us know
          only know 13 species. Some of us just know what a fish is. I will
          provide the top 8 most commonly caught fish. I will be sure
          to add what fish species need a special license or a stamp to harvest
          the fish. You should always have a license if you are 16 years or older.
          Note: This information is noted from inland fishing. If you are 
          interested in boundary water fishing, research that before
          going out!

      <h2>Largemouth Bass</h2>
      <a href="fish_images/largemouth.jpg"><img src="fish_images/largemouththumb.jpg" height="81" width="202" alt="Largemouth Bass"></a>
        <p>
        One of the more popular sport fish to capture. Best spot to find them
        are in the weeds in warm months. They love warm water and will strike just
        about anything. Go weedless to prevent snagging due to their 
        habitat. Always match the hatch. In Wisconsin, we have crayfish and panfish.
        What anglers will do is mimic a crayfish with a crankbait or use a
        swimbait that looks like a bluegill. Don't be afraid if you catch a 
        Northern Pike while bass fishing. Largemouth Bass total 
        daily bag limit is 5.
        </p>
      <h2>Smallmouth Bass</h2>
      <a href="fish_images/smallmouth.jpg"><img src="fish_images/smallthumb.jpg" height="112" width="242" alt="Smallmouth Bass"></a>
        <p>
        A relative to the Largemouth Bass. People love catching both bass, but
        the smallmouth bass is a difficult catch. Their preferred habitat is 
        rocky streams or anywhere that has rocks. Best time to fish them is 
        in June, after spawning, and early fall. To catch one, use baits that 
        sit on the surface of the water. These are referred to as topwater 
        baits. Use light gear and cast into rock beds or logs.
        Smallmouth Bass total daily bag limit is 0.
        </p>
      <h2>Panfish</h2>
      <a href="fish_images/bluegill.jpg"><img src="fish_images/gillthumb.jpg" height="110" width="180" alt="Bluegill"></a>
        <p>
          The picture is a bluegill. It's one of the many species classified
          as a panfish. Other fish include Pumpkinseed, Yellow Perch, White and
          Black Crappie (Crappie is pronunced "croppie"). Crappie pronunciation
          is always a big debate. Panfish usually remain in shallow water
          around vegitation. Put a bobber on your line, a hook, and a split
          shot weight above your hook. Great baits to use are wax worms,
          commonly called waxies, and earthworms. Wax worms have the greatest
          results. Be careful on the time of year you fish. August panfishing,
          your need a small hook. There are a lot of baby panfish out.
          Panfish have a 25 fish in total daily bag limit.
        </p>
      <h2>Walleye</h2>
      <a href="fish_images/walleye.jpg"><img src="fish_images/walleyethumb.jpg" height="117" width="256" alt="Walleye"></a>
        <p>
          Walleye are probably the spookiest looking fish. They don't like
          pretty but they make up for it in taste. Fresh walleye is the best
          fish to eat. These fish are easy to confuse with sauger. Best way to
          tell these two fish apart is, walleye have a spot of white on 
          their caudal fin. These fish are best caught in the early morning
          and at night. These fish are in the shallows in the night and
          early mornings. During the day, you want to fish deep waters.
          Good bait to use are crankbaits when you fish during the day.
          The bag limit for walleye is 5. Chippewa County is in Ceded Territory
          and our bag limit is only 3. This information matter becaues you can
          be fined for having over the bag limit.
        </p>
      <h2>Northern Pike</h2>
      <a href="fish_images/northernpike.jpg"><img src="fish_images/pikethumb.jpg" height="83" width="225" alt="Northern Pike"></a>
        <p>
          These are aggressive fish. If you handle them improperly, you can
          kill them. For their nature, it's surprsing how delicate they are.
          These predators hide in weed beds waiting for prey to pass by them.
          These fish have sharp teeth and having a steel leader increases your
          hook up ratio. They can bite through fishing line. Any bait
          that mimics a dying fish will attract them, but just about anything
          will lure them in. Before going out for the day, see
          where your county is in relation to U.S. Highway 10. If your north,
          you can 5 pike. If your south, you can only bag 2.
          Some of Chippewa County is north of U.S. Highway 10.
          (Some cities north of Highway 10: Chippewa Falls, Cornell, Menomonie)
        </p>
      <h2>Muskellunge</h2>
      <a href="fish_images/musky.jpg"><img src="fish_images/muskythumb.jpg" height="52" width="147" alt="Muskellunge"></a>
        <p>
          Wisconsin's State Fish! And the largest predatory fish in Wisconsin.
          This fish looks similar to the Northern Pike. When these two fish
          breed together, they make a Tiger Musky. An unnamed source says Bob Lake,
          a lake a few miles outside of Bloomer, has some Tiger Musky. Musky
          lurk in weed beds and old logs for prey. And typically live alone.
          Tackle you should have on hand is steel leaders. These fish can
          be 50 inches long and will have a good fight. And you don't want it
          snapping your line. Jerkbaits, Spoons, and Bucktails will be a good
          bait to throw. The bag limit for these are only 1. Watch the
          size limit though!
        </p>
      <h2>Catfish</h2>
      <a href="fish_images/flatheadcatfish.jpg"><img src="fish_images/catfishthumb.jpg" height="35" width="90" alt="Flathead Catfish"></a>
        <p>
          Wisconsin has four species of catfish. The image above is a flathead
          catfish. This one is the more common cats. The other common catfish
          is a channel catfish. These fish remain in the deepest parts of
          water during the day. At night, they come up shallow. To fish for
          them, you want to mix up your own bait. A good YouTube channel
          to watch for this would be 'Catfish and Carp'. The daily bag limit on
          catfish is 10 in total.
        </p>
      <h2>Trout</h2>
      <a href="fish_images/rainbowtrout.jpg"><img src="fish_images/troutthumb.jpg" height="68" width="184" alt="Rainbow Trout"></a>
        <p>
          There are four species of trout in Wisconsin. The image is a Rainbow
          Trout. To fish these, you need a Trout Stamp and your fishing license.
          The best place to fish for trout is in streams and rivers.
          You can fish for them elsewhere but the best place to fish
          is streams. The best bait you can throw is flies.
          All four species love flies. Total bag limit is 5.
