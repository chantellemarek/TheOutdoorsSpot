      <h2>Hunting Gear</h2>
        <p>In Wisconsin, hunting is probably one the most exciting times.
          Don't be discouraged if you don't have private land to hunt on.
          If you ask around, you can find public hunting lands. Do take a hunters 
          education class! The class is filled with so much important
          information. Hunting safely and the proper and safe handling of a 
          firearm can't be expressed enough! People have died and have faced
          grave injuries from poor hunting skills and miss use of a firearm.
          On the previous page, you seen some of the more popular animals 
          hunting in the state. If you need to search something in the official
          Wisconsin regulation book, I have linked a hunting .pdf and the 
          website to the Wisconsin DNR home page in the resources tab.</p>
          <h3>Firearms and Ammunition</h3>
            <p>The firearm one needs to hunt has always been a controversial
            topic. <b>IT IS LEGAL</b> in the State of Wisconsin to use an AR-15. The
            rounds are .223 caliber, <b>but if it's automatic, IT IS ILLEGAL</b>.
            You want to know what season you are in and have the proper
            license. You can't use a rifle for hunting game birds. You can use
            either a rifle or shotgun for Gun Deer season. If you are a bow
            hunter, you need a bow that has more than 30 pounds of draw weight.
            Crossbows need a minimum of 100 pounds of draw weight 
            to be legal. Note: If you have an archers license, you can only
            use a bow. If you have a crossbow license, you can only use a
            crossbow. Crossbow bolts are at least 14 inches long to be used.
            If you used metal broadheads, they have to be 7/8 of an inch and 
            sharp at all times.
          <h3>What to Wear</h3>
            <p>What you should wear depends on the season. In November,
               it's Gun Deer Season. You are required to wear blaze orange if
               you are an active hunter in the season. The orange should cover
               50% of your body. The 50% should be from the waist up and you
               should wear an orange hat. In September, bow and crossbow season
               opens up. Hunters can wear blaze orange or camoflauge. When you
               walk out to your stand, it's a smart to wear orange until you
               make it to your hunting spot.
          <h3>Tree Stands and Blinds</h3>
            <p>Some hunters prefer hunting stands and some choose a blind
               over a stand. If you use a blind, there are some safety tips
               to keep in mind. You have to mark the surrounding area with
               orange to let people know that's where your setup is. This will
               prevent accidents and confusion. And ensure you will find
               the blind the next day. It's more effort, but
               it's better to be safe than sorry. The next option are tree
               stands. You can build one or buy them. Being around and using a 
               built tree stand isn't scary. DIY a tree stands ensures you 
               get what you want and it lasts when using quality materials.
               The stands you buy from the store can sometimes be a gamble.
               It's likely you won't fall in love with one. What you buy 
               is what you get. The space you have is very limited and they
               leave you exposed to the elements. These kind of stands are
               good for bow hunters. It gives them plenty of room to draw back.
