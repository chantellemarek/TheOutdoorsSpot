      <h2>Fishing Gear</h2>
        <p>
        This will cover the basics needed to start fishing. It will have a look
        at three common fishing reels and tackle. When starting out,
        don't waste your money on the most expensive gear. You don't know
        if you will like fishing and the chance of you losing lures is high.
        You will break the bank buying everything you don't need.
        You do not want to buy a $15 crankbait just to use it a few times
        because you threw it into water full of weeds.

              First reel just about everyone starts with. Low quality and only
              useable for a few seasons. Less hassle compared to a spinning and
              baitcasting reel. Great reel for children to use.

              High quality compared to spinning and spincast reels. The price 
              is higher and need more maintenence. Can not be used for light
              gear. If you do, you run the risk of a birds nest.
              </td>
              <td>
              The most common in the fishing world. They can go from $10 up to
              $1000. The higher priced reels are better quality. These
              can be light gear or heavy gear. It all depends on what you want.
              These reels don't need a lot of maintence. And will last longer
              with care.

      <h2>Fishing Tackle</h2>
        <p>
        Once you have a rod and reel combo or a rod and reel,
        you are going to need tackle to go along with that. To keep this simple
        and easy, I will break this down into three categories. They will
        consist of line, lures, and hooks and weights. Don't forget
        to get a tackle box to store your lures! A handful of sharp hooks
        isn't fun.
        </p>
      <h3>Fishing Line</h3>
        <p>Fishing line is important. Without it, you can't go fishing. Line is
          what you want to put a lot of research into. There are three types: 
          monofilament, flurocarbon, and braid. Each one has pro and cons.</p>
          <h4>Braid:</h4>
            <p>Good for topwater lures because of it's floating ability. Knot
          tying is difficult. It is expensive and has a shoter life span than
          monofilament and flurocarbon. Do not use around rocks or sharp 
          objects.</p>
          <h4>Monofilament:</h4>
            <p>Cheapest line on the market. The easiest to find in stores.
          This line comes standard on most reels purchased. Has a long life
          span. This line floats, absorbs water, and stretches.</p>
          <h4>Flurocarbon</h4>
            <p>Mid-range price. Easier to find in store than braid. This
            line is optimal for sinking baits or diving baits. An example bait
            perfect for this line is a crankbait. These baits dive and sinking
            line gives it the best action and depth. This line is good for 
            going on the reel or being used as a leader.
            </p>
      <h3>Fishing Lures</h3>
        <p>Fishing lures has several categories. Everybody labels them
        differently. I will break this down into four categories:
        soft plastics, hard body lures, and bladed baits.</p>
          <h4>Soft Plastics</h4>
            <p>One of the most popular lures to use. Purchase brands like YUM
            and Zoom if you are interested in dabbling with soft plastics.
            These two brands are cheap and give you a decent number of plastics.
            The issue with soft plastics is the color choice. You have to know
            what color to pick based on the water and clarity you fish.
            Remember to pick plastics that will attract fish. Pretty colors are
            good at sucking people in too! A little guide to help you will be below.<br>
            Clear Water: Natural colors like Green Pumpkin. You can
            use plastics that also has glitter inside them.<br>
            Stained Water: Bright colors like Bubblegum or Chartreuse. Or
            for contrast, use Black or Junebug.<br>
            Murky Water: Same as stained water.<br>
          <h4>Hard Body Lures</h4>
            <p>The most popular hard body lures known are crankbaits and
            anything that works on the top of the water, also know as top water baits.
            Other lures include jerkbaits and swimbaits. Crankbaits mimic
            dying or injured fish and have a rattle inside them. These make
            fish strike because of the vibration and easy chance of food.
            When it's a cold, cloudy day, break out a topwater bait. Bass
            commonly attack because the surface will be cool. When a fish bites,
            it will look like an explosion in the water.
          <h4>Bladed Baits</h4>
            <p>Bladed baits are spinnerbaits, chatterbaits, and buzzbaits.
            They had some kind of motion on them. Another lure I'm adding
            to this list is a Spoon. The most common one you see is the
            red and white pattern called a Dardevle. (Pronounced dare devil.)
            These baits are reaction baits. When fishing is rough, these have
            vibrations to help fish find it's location.</p>
      <h3>Terminal Tackle</h3>
        <p>Terminal tackle is hooks, weights, barrel swivels, snap swivels,
        and anything that can be tied to the line. We are going to talk about
        hooks and weights.<br>
        There are several brands of hooks. Buy hooks that are multi-use.
        Your tackle box will be filled with several types of hook if you
        buy them for one task. Two hooks worth keeping around and supplied
        are Weedless Hooks and EWG (extra wide gap) Hooks. EWG hooks help
        rig soft plastics you buy. Weedless hooks are great for Wacky Rigs
        and navagating water with a lot of weeds to get hung up on.<br>
        Don't be intimidated by all the weight styles and sizes you see in
        a store. The many weights have different uses. Egg sinkers and
        bullet weights are perfect for Texas Rigs and Carolina Rigs.
        Splitshot weights are good for people using bobbers (some people call
        them floats). A good use for splitshots is modifying a Wacky Rig.
        Pinch on a few a few inches above your hook. For the size, the 
        bigger you pick, the faster they sink. Fish will be able to detect
        the bigger sized weight compared to something small. Watch out for
        tungsten weights so you don't accidentally grab them. Not every store
        sells them and they cost more than lead weights. Tungsten requires less
        materials to make and that's what makes them good.
