    <h2>Hunting Safety</h2>
      <p>
         The main idea here is safety with firearms. They are one of the top 
         dangers when it comes to hunting.
      </p>
        <h3>4 Rules of Gun Safety</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Always point your barrel in a safe direction.</li>
            <li>Always treat every gun as if it's loaded.</li>
            <li>Always be sure of your target and beyond.</li>
            <li>Always keep your finger off the trigger until your ready to
                fire. Your finger should be outside the trigger guard unless
                you're firing.</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>S-T-O-P</h3>
          <p>An acronym to know when you find yourself lost. Everyone begins
             to panic when they get lost. Panicing out in the woods isn't
             a good place to do it. You lose your thinking ability. Once
             that happens, the best tool you have is gone. If you are hunting
             with a gun, you can use it to make noise and help people find you.
             Bow hunters can't do this. PLEASE DON'T SHOOT YOUR ARROWS IN THE
             AIR! It's dangerous and you don't know where they will land.
             I know someone that got lost and did this.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>(S)it : Take a moment and sit down.</li>
                <li>(T)hink : Think about your surroundings, what direction
                     you came from, and the time.</li>
                <li>(O)bserve : Observe your surroundings.</li>
                <li>(P)lan : Planning makes the difference in fending off
                    your fight-or-flight response. Natural reaction is flight.
                    You begin running around in panic and get in a worse spot
                    than when you realized you were lost.</li>
              </ul>
        <h3>TIPS</h3>
          <p>Get certified before going out for a hunt. It's worth the time
             and money. You will learn a lot. The class will even discuss
             survival techniques for if you get lost. When you do leave for a
             hunt, let your family know where you will be and expected
             time to be back home. This will raised concern when you aren't
             home. Police officers and search and rescue teams can find you
             better when they know your general hunting area. Pack up food,
             water, a first aid kit, a map, and a compass. When hunting, you
             are out for long periods of time. A change of clothes is another
             good idea. Fall time is cold and wet. Pack extra socks. Feet
             tend to freeze first. Wet socks are terrible. If you
             having a dog with you hunting, put them in some blaze orange.
             It will prevent accidents.</p>
        <h3>Golden Rules</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The 4 Rules of Gun Safety will always be #1</li>
            <li>Check your barrel for obstructions and use proper ammunition</li>
            <li>Unload firearm when not in use</li>
            <li>Never point a firearm at anthing you don't intend to shoot</li>
            <li>Don't run, jump, or climb with a loaded firearm</li>
            <li>Store firearms and ammunition seperately and safely</li>
            <li>DON'T DRINK ALCOHOL BEFORE OR DURING SHOOTING!</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you can't comply to laws or follow any of these
             stated safety tips, you should't be handling a firearm
             or be out on a hunt. This is a sport for responsible
             people.</p>
    <h2>Fishing Safety</h2>
      <p>
        Fishing doesn't have too many things to watch out for.
        If you are a boating angler, you have a lot to know.
        You or someone operating the boat should have a boaters
        license and the items a boat should have out on the water.
